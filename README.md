# Machine Learning Internship Projects ‚Äì Elevvo Pathways

Welcome to the repository showcasing the hands-on projects I completed during my **4-week Machine Learning Internship** with **Elevvo Pathways**.

Over the course of this internship, I worked on 4 diverse and practical machine learning tasks. Each project explores a unique aspect of ML ‚Äî from supervised regression and classification to unsupervised clustering and deep learning with CNNs.
